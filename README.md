## Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm `Lachlan Rumery`<sub>(he/him)</sub>.
I'm currently in Y10 at high school, and enjoy coding.


***What am I currently working on?*** <br>

I'm currently working on a google extension that allows you to highlight text on a webpage. Although there are many extensions that can already do this, I have found that a significant number of features are looked behind paywalls .
